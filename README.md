# Predicting Lemurs Frontend

This repository serves the frontend for the Predicting Lemurs project. Its backend or API can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/khushaal-nandwani/predicting-lemurs-api) and the original paper, which includes the journey on how models were created can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/khushaal-nandwani/predicting-lemurs).

The frontend is live at [this site](http://3.99.183.165:5173/). The browser may prompt you of security issues, but the site is safe to visit, I promise. The site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
